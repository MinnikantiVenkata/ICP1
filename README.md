Here is the link to the source code:


1. 	– In this program, I have given the input string as “python” and used the replace() method to delete 2 characters and reversed the string using slicing
    - In this program, I have allowed the user to enter two integers to take them as input, perform 4 arithmetic operations on them and print the output. 

2. 	I wrote the program to replace the word “python” with “pythons” from the input sentence using replace() method. The string replace() method replaces a character with a new character.

3.	I wrote a program that takes a number as score of a student out of 100. The program prints letter grade of the student. I have used the grading scheme being used in our class. User input goes to if else loop conditions to determine grades. Output displays invalid score in case of score entered more than 100. Grades are printed according to the range of marks given.
